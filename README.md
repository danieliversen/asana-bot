- **TOKEN**: your personal Asana TOKEN (format _Bearer XXX_)
- **PROJECT**: the Asana project this bot should be actively listening to events

## Functions

- **Hello** - Dummy function to validate's bot availability
- **Setup** - Code to configure [Asana's webhook](https://asana.com/developers/api-reference/webhooks)
- **Assign** - Assigns all new tasks created that have no assignee to you.
